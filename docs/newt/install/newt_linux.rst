Installing Newt on Linux
------------------------

You can install the latest release (1.1.0) of the newt tool from a
Debian binary package (amd64). You can also download and build the
latest release version of newt from source.

This page shows you how to:

1. Set up your computer to download Debian binary packages from the
   runtimeco APT repository.
   **Note:** The key for signing the repository has changed. If you set
   up your computer before release 1.1.0, you will need to download and
   import the public key again.

2. Install the latest release version of newt from a Debian binary
   package. You can use apt-get to install the package or manually
   download and install the Debian binary package.

3. Download, build, and install the latest release version of newt from
   source.

4. Install an earlier version of newt.

If you are installing on an amd64 platform, we recommend that you
install from the binary package.

**Note:** We have tested the newt tool binary and apt-get install from
the runtimeco APT repository for Ubuntu version 16. Earlier Ubuntu
versions (for example: Ubuntu 14) may have incompatibility with the
repository. You can manually download and install the Debian binary
package.

**Note:** See `Setting Up a Go Environment to Contribute to Newt and
Newtmgr Tools </faq/go_env>`__ if you want to:

-  Use the newt tool with the latest updates from the master branch. The
   master branch may be unstable and we recommend that you use the
   latest stable release version.
-  Contribute to the newt tool.

Setting Up Your Computer to use apt-get to Install the Package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The newt Debian packages are stored in a private APT repository on
**https://github/runtimeco/debian-mynewt**. To use apt-get, you must set
up the following on your computer to retrieve packages from the
repository:

**Note**: You only need to perform this setup once on your computer.
However, if you previously downloaded and imported the public key for
the runtimeco APT repository, you will need to perform step 2 again as
the key has changed.

1. Install the ``apt-transport-https`` package to use HTTPS to retrieve
   packages.
2. Download the public key for the runtimeco APT repository and import
   the key into the apt keychain.
3. Add the repository for the binary and source packages to the apt
   source list.

Install the apt-transport-https package:

.. code-block:: console

    $sudo apt-get update
    $sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https

Download the public key for the runtimeco apt repo (**Note:** There is a
``-`` after ``apt-key add``):

.. code-block:: console

    wget -qO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runtimeco/debian-mynewt/master/mynewt.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -

Add the repository for the binary and source packages to the
``mynewt.list`` apt source list file.

.. code-block:: console

    $sudo -s
    [sudo] password for <user>:
    root$ cat > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mynewt.list <<EOF
    deb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runtimeco/debian-mynewt/master latest main
    EOF
    root$exit

**Note:** Do not forget to exit the root shell.

Verify the content of the source list file:

.. code-block:: console

    $more /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mynewt.list
    deb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runtimeco/debian-mynewt/master latest main

Update the available packages:

.. code-block:: console

    $sudo apt-get update

**Note:** If you are not using Ubuntu version 16, you may see the
following errors. We have provided instructions on how to manually
download and install the binary package.

.. code-block:: console


    W: Failed to fetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runtimeco/debian-mynewt/master/dists/latest/main/source/Sources  Ht

## Installing the Latest Release of Newt from a Binary Package

You can use either apt-get to install the package, or manually download
and install the Debian binary package.

#### Method 1: Using apt-get to Upgrade or to Install

Run the following commands to upgrade or install the latest version of
newt:

.. code-block:: console


    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install newt

#### Method 2: Downloading and Installing the Debian Package Manually

Download and install the package manually.

.. code-block:: console

    $wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runtimeco/debian-mynewt/master/pool/main/n/newt/newt_1.1.0-1_amd64.deb
    $sudo dpkg -i newt_1.1.0-1_amd64.deb

See `Checking the Installed Version of Newt <#check>`__ to verify that
you are using the installed version of newt.

### Installing the Latest Release of Newt from a Source Package

If you are running Linux on a different architecture, you can build and
install the latest release version of newt from source.

1. You need Go version 1.7.6 or higher to build Newt version 1.0.0.
Currently, the latest Go version that Ubuntu installs is 1.6. Run
``go version`` to check if you have Go 1.7.6 installed. You can download
Go from https://golang.org/dl/.

2. Download and unpack the newt source:

.. code-block:: console


    $ wget -P /tmp https://github.com/apache/mynewt-newt/archive/mynewt_1_1_0_tag.tar.gz
    $ tar -xzf /tmp/mynewt_1_1_0_tag.tar.gz

3. Run the build.sh to build the newt tool.

.. code-block:: console


    $ cd mynewt-newt-mynewt_1_1_0_tag
    $ ./build.sh
    $ rm /tmp/mynewt_1_1_0_tag.tar.gz

4. You should see the ``newt/newt`` executable. Move the executable to
a bin directory in your PATH:

-  If you previously built newt from the master branch, you can move the
   binary to your $GOPATH/bin directory.

.. code-block:: console

       $ mv newt/newt $GOPATH/bin

-  If you are installing newt for the first time and do not have a Go
   workspace set up, you can move the binary to /usr/bin or a directory
   in your PATH:

.. code-block:: console

       $ mv newt/newt /usr/bin

 ### Checking the Installed Version of Newt

1. Check which newt you are using and that the version is the latest
release version.

.. code-block:: console

    $which newt
    /usr/bin/newt
    $newt version
    Apache Newt version: 1.1.0

2. Get information about newt:

.. code-block:: console

    $newt
    Newt allows you to create your own embedded application based on the Mynewt
    operating system. Newt provides both build and package management in a single
