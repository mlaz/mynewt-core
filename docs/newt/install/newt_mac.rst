 **Notes:** Homebrew bottles for newt 1.1.0 are available for Mac OS
Sierra, El Captian, and Yosemite. If you are running an earlier version
of Mac OS, the installation will install the latest version of Go and
compile newt locally.

 ### Checking the Installed Version

Check that you are using the installed version of newt:

.. code-block:: console


    $which newt
    /usr/local/bin/newt
    $ls -l /usr/local/bin/newt
    lrwxr-xr-x  1 user  staff  36 Jul 25 19:04 /usr/local/bin/newt -> ../Cellar/mynewt-newt/1.1.0/bin/newt
    $newt version
    Apache Newt version: 1.1.0

**Note:** If you previously built newt from source and the output of
``which newt`` shows
":math:`GOPATH/bin/newt", you will need to move "`\ GOPATH/bin" after
"/usr/local/bin" for your PATH in ~/.bash\_profile, and source
~/.bash\_profile.

 ### Installing Earlier Release Versions of Newt

If you want to install newt 1.0, run the following commands:

.. code-block:: console


    $ brew update
    $ brew install mynewt-newt@1.0

**Note:** This is a keg-only installation. newt 1.0 is installed in
/usr/local/Cellar/mynewt-newt@1.0/1.0.0/bin but not symlinked into
/usr/local/bin.

If you need this version of newt first in your PATH, run the following
commands:

.. code-block:: console


    $ echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/Cellar/mynewt-newt@1.0/1.0.0/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile
    $ source ~/.bash_profile

 You can also manually symlink into /usr/local/bin as follows:

1. Unlink newt if you have the latest version of newt installed:

   ::

       $ brew unlink mynewt-newt

2. Link mynewt-newt@1.0 into /usr/local/bin:

   ::

       $ brew link -f mynewt-newt@1.0

Installing Newt from the Master Branch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend that you use the latest release version (1.1.0) of newt. If
you would like to use the master branch with the latest updates, you can
install newt from the HEAD of the master branch.

\*\* Notes: \*\*

-  The master branch may be unstable.
-  This installation will install the latest version of Go on your
   computer, if it is not installed, and compile newt locally.

 If you previously installed newt using brew, unlink the current
version:

.. code-block:: console

    $brew unlink mynewt-newt

 Install the latest unstable version of newt from the master branch:

.. code-block:: console

    $ brew install mynewt-newt --HEAD
    ==> Installing mynewt-newt from runtimeco/mynewt
