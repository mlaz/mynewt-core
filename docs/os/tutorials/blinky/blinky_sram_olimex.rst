Run Blinky from SRAM without bootloader
---------------------------------------

Objective
~~~~~~~~~

To download an application image directly into the embedded SRAM in the
microcontroller and run it without the bootloader. This tutorial
describes how you do it on an Olimex STM32 board.

What you need
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. STM32-E407 development board from Olimex. You can order it from
   `http://www.mouser.com <http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Olimex-Ltd/STM32-E407/?qs=UN6GZl1KCcit6Ye0xmPO4A%3D%3D>`__,
   `http://www.digikey.com <http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/STM32-E407/1188-1093-ND/3726951>`__,
   and other places.
2. ARM-USB-TINY-H connector with JTAG interface for debugging ARM
   microcontrollers (comes with the ribbon cable to hook up to the
   board)
3. USB A-B type cable to connect the debugger to your personal computer
4. Personal Computer with Mac OS (Mac: OS X Yosemite Version 10.10.5) or
   Linux box (Ubuntu 14.10: Utopic Unicorn)
5. An account on Github repository and *git* installed on your computer.
6. It is assumed you have already installed newt tool.
7. It is assumed you already installed native tools as described
   `here <../get_started/native_tools.html>`__

Also, we assume that you're familiar with UNIX shells. Let's gets
started!

Prepare the Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Make sure the PATH environment variable includes the $HOME/dev/go/bin
   directory.

Create a project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a new project to hold your work. For a deeper understanding, you
can read about project creation in `Get Started -- Creating Your First
Project <../get_started/project_create.html>`__ or just follow the
commands below.

.. code-block:: console

        $ mkdir ~/dev
        $ cd ~/dev
        $ newt new myproj
        Downloading project skeleton from apache/incubator-mynewt-blinky...
        Installing skeleton in myproj...
        Project myproj successfully created.

        $cd myproj

        $ newt install -v 
        apache-mynewt-core
        Downloading repository description for apache-mynewt-core... success!
        ...
        apache-mynewt-core successfully installed version 0.7.9-none

Create a target
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Change directory to ~/dev/myproj directory and define the *blinky*
target inside myproj, using the *newt* tool. Starting with the target
name, assign specific aspects of the project, as shown below, to pull
the appropriate packages and build the right bundle or list for the
board. For example, we set the build\_profile, board support package
(bsp), and app.

.. code-block:: console

        $ newt target create blinky
        $ newt target set blinky build_profile=debug
        $ newt target set blinky bsp=@apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard
        $ newt target set blinky app=apps/blinky
        $ newt target show blinky
        targets/blinky
            app=apps/blinky
            bsp=hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard
            build_profile=debug

Build the image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next, let's build the image for the above target. By default, the linker
script within the ``hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard`` package builds
an image for flash memory, which we don't want; instead, we want an
image for the SRAM, so you need to switch that script with
``run_from_sram.ld``.

Afer you build the target, you can find the executable *blinky.elf* in
the project directory *~/dev/myproj/bin/blinky/apps/blinky/.*

.. code-block:: console

        $ cd ~/dev/myproj/repos/apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard/
        $ diff olimex_stm32-e407_devboard.ld run_from_sram.ld
        (some diff will be displayed)
        $ cp run_from_sram.ld olimex_stm32-e407_devboard.ld
        $ cd ~/dev/myproj
        $ newt build blinky
        Compiling case.c
        Compiling suite.c
        ...
        Linking blinky.elf
        App successfully built:~/dev/myproj/bin/blinky/apps/blinky/blinky.elf
        $ ls ~/dev/myproj/bin/blinky/apps/blinky/
            blinky.elf      blinky.elf.bin     blinky.elf.cmd  
            blinky.elf.lst  blinky.elf.map

Prepare the hardware to boot from embedded SRAM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Locate the boot jumpers on the board.

|Alt Layout - Top View| |Alt Layout - Bottom View|

-  B1\_1/B1\_0 and B0\_1/B0\_0 are PTH jumpers. Note that because the
   markings on the board may not always be accurate, when in doubt, you
   should always refer to the manual for the correct positioning. Since
   the jumpers are a pair, they should move together, and as such, the
   pair is responsible for the boot mode when bootloader is present. To
   locate the bootloader, the board searches in three places: User Flash
   Memory, System Memory or the Embedded SRAM. For this Blinky project,
   we will configure it to boot from SRAM by jumpering **B0\_1** and
   **B1\_1**.

-  Connect USB-OTG#2 in the picture above to a USB port on your computer
   (or a powered USB hub to make sure there is enough power available to
   the board).

-  The red PWR LED should be lit.

-  Connect the JTAG connector to the SWD/JTAG interface on the board.
   The other end of the cable should be connected to the USB port or hub
   of your computer.

Let's Go!
~~~~~~~~~

-  Ensure that you are in the blinky project directory with the
   *blinky.elf* executable. Run the debug command in the *newt* tool.
   You'll see some status messages as shown below. In case you need to
   halt the debugging session, you can issue an ``-c "reset halt"``
   command.

.. code-block:: console

        $ newt debug blinky

        Info : device id = 0x10036413
        Info : flash size = 1024kbytes

Check the value of the msp (main service pointer) register. If it is not
0x10010000 as indicated above, you will have to manually set it after
you open the gdb tool and load the image on it. For example,

.. code-block:: console

        (gdb) set $msp=0x10010000

Now load the image and type "c" or "continue" from the GNU debugger.

.. code-block:: console

        (gdb) load ~/dev/myproj/bin/blinky/apps/blinky/blinky.elf   
        Loading section .text, size 0x16b88 lma 0x20000000
        Loading section .ARM.exidx, size 0x18 lma 0x20016b88
        Loading section .data, size 0x9ec lma 0x20016ba0
        Start address 0x200004b8, load size 95628
        Transfer rate: 74 KB/sec, 3825 bytes/write.
        (gdb) c
        Continuing.

-  Voil√†! The board's LED should be blinking at 1 Hz. Success!
