NimBLE Host
===========

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

At a high level, the NimBLE stack is divided into two components:

-  Host
-  Controller

This document is an API reference for the host component. If you are
interested in the general structure of the NimBLE stack and its non-host
components, you might want to read the `BLE
introduction <../ble_intro.html>`__.

The host sits directly below the application, and it serves as the
interface to the application for all BLE operations.
